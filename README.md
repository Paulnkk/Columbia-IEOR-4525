# Markowitz-Portfolio-Optimization

This implementation was created as part of a course on portfolio optimization.
In the following, we consider the Markowitz model for efficient portfolios. It is a convex nonlinear optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using convex global optimization techniques. 

For this purpose, I have implemented a barrier term based method, which solves the problem described above for different betas in an approximate way (an efficient portfolio is calculated for each beta).

Finally, I visualized the efficient portfolios in a mu-sigma diagram (expected return versus standard deviation).
